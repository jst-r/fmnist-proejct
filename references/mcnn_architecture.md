## Summary
This research evaluates the performance of deep Convolutional Neural Networks on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The authors demonstrate that architectures with multiple convolutional and pooling layers significantly outperform traditional machine learning models like SVM and MLP. The `MCNN15` model in this project is inspired by these findings, utilizing a deep stack of convolutional layers (15 layers total) to capture complex features in fashion imagery.
