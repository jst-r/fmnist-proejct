## Summary
Leo Breiman's foundational paper introduces the Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees during training. By using bagging and random feature selection, it significantly reduces variance and overfitting. In this project, Random Forest serves as the traditional machine learning baseline for the Fashion-MNIST classification task.
