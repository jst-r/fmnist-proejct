## Summary
Official and community-driven benchmarks for Fashion-MNIST show a distinct performance hierarchy. Traditional models like Random Forest generally achieve between 87% and 88.5% accuracy. In contrast, standard CNNs consistently reach 91-93%, while state-of-the-art architectures (like ResNet or specialized deep CNNs) exceed 96%. This benchmark provides the context for evaluating the results of the Random Forest baseline and the `MCNN15` model used in this project.
