## Summary
This paper evaluates how various data augmentation techniques—specifically affine transformations like rotation, translation, and scaling—enhance the generalization of CNNs. It shows that these strategies act as powerful regularizers. This project applies affine transformations (RandomAffine) and horizontal flips to the Fashion-MNIST training set to improve model robustness.
