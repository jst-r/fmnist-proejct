## Summary
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset consisting of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of fashion products across 10 categories. It was designed as a direct replacement for the original MNIST digit dataset, offering a more challenging benchmark for machine learning algorithms while maintaining the same image size and data format. This project uses Fashion-MNIST as the primary data source for training both the CNN and Random Forest models.
