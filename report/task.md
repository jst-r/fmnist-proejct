Background: Zalando, a company in the fashion retailer industry, introduced the Fashion-MNIST dataset in 2017. This dataset includes 70 thousand images in 10 categories of fashion products including T-shirts,
trousers, coats, sneakers, among others. Retailers can greatly benefit from systems that automatically
recognize and categorize fashion products from images.
Task: Evaluate two methods to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset:

- Describe Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (Tensorflow, 2024) and the best Radom Forest Classifier
  introduced in (Xiao et al., 2017). Describe your implementations, that is, dataset partition and
  architecture for each classifier and training strategy. Evaluate both classifiers presenting the confusion
  matrices of the train and test sets. Besides, include a table presenting precision and recall values for the
  train and test sets. Report the training times for each classifier.
- Analyze the categories for which each classifier performed worst. Try to find an explanation for the low
  performance of those categories. Compare both classifiers and recommend which classifier should be
  used in production. Justify your recommendation.
- Attach the code at the end of the report.

  Note: Whichever task you choose, please always consider the following:
  • The report should be between 7 to 10 pages + code. Attach a pdf of the python notebook after it run with
  all results. Alternatively, share the link to your repository.
  • Suggested structure of the report. Page 1. Include a textual abstract and a graphical abstract. It should
  present the motivation, method, results, and conclusion. Page 2. Introduction and literature review. Page

3. Present the method in text and as a graphic representation. Page 4 and 5. Analysis of results including
   tables and graphics. Page 6. Conclusion. Page 7. References. Appendix: The code.
