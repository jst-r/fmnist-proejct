Fashion mnist is blah blah blah.

Random forest is ...
I took rf hyperparams from (Xiao et al., 2017)

CNN is ...
I chose MCNN15 because the paper showed good performance, the architecture is simle and the paper had a decent description of how it was trained.

arXiv:2406.03478v1 seems like a decent overview of CNNs for fashion mnist. However, I tried reproducing some of the results and failed. 99 percent accuracy doesn't seem realistic for the trainig procedures used.

I'd use a CNN in production cause it's much more accurate. The training is significanly slower and thus more expensive. But it's probably fine.
